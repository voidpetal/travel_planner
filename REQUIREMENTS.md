A good plan (given a place and dates) consists of
- Weather, and plan the activities accordingly
- Where to eat (specific, authentic, local or interesting places)
- Cultural events during the time there, anything authentic?
- Which bars, cafes
- anything authentic like beers, cakes, etc
- what to visit in that place (natural beauty, buildings, statues, art, museums)
- Price estimate for everything including food, transport
- how to get there and back
- thorough plan of activities, such that they are not rushed but filled with stuff to see


Next steps:

- Acommodation recommendation
- Tour Map

- Create reports and logs in results folder
- Add pictures and other info (webpage, etc) to the travel reports
- Add structured personas, e.g. demographics, preferences, etc.
- Crete nice UI for weather forecast, food recommendations, restaurants on the map, etc.
